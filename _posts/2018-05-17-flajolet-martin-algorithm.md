excerpt: "In this problem we are asked to estimate the number m based on observations of the stream $h \{a_1 , a 2 , . . . , a n i$, where a $i âˆˆ {1, 2, . . . , m}. Keep in mind that n and m are quite large, and the standard-approach of keeping track of the number of distinct objects we have seen up to now, is not an option."
