## Overview

[Mining Rig Assembly](http://rigassembly.web.engr.illinois.edu/index.php) is a web-based application that allows the users to browse different parts of a mining rig, store rig setups, and estimate the performance of their setups on one integrated site. Users can set their expected payback periods for the setups, and our application will calculate the potential profits of them based on real-time price information, and notify the user when their expected payback periods can be achieved.

#### Several creative features:

1. Users can set their expected cost and expected profit.
2. This website calculates the lowest cost of mining rig by comparing prices from different websites.
3. This website can notify the users when the expected profit is met.

## Advanced Functions
1. Calculate the payback period of different mining rig setups
This function is the core of this application. It allows the users to plan their investments without having to monitor every little aspect of the market at all time. It is especially useful, and convenient to have in the current situation because of how rapidly the prices are changing.
2. Compare between different parts and setups with visualization
This can help user easier to understand the tradeoff of different setups and choose the best setup based on the comparison.
