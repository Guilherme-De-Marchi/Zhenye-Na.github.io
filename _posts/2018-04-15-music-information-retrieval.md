## Overview

The goals of this project are to perform Audio Analysis (minimum goals) and build an Automatic Music Generator (maximum goals). The ability to produce songs is highly desirable by listeners and is a feature of live parties, radio shows, and on-line recordings.  

## blablabla

These are two main parts of the ﬁnal project.

1. **Semantic Analysis of Song Lyrics**  
	I will explore the use of song lyrics for automatic indexing of music. Using lyrics we apply a standard text processing technique to characterize their semantic content. Then determine artist similarity in this space. We found lyrics can be used to discover natural genre clusters.

2. **Music Audio Analysis and Generation**  
	I will perform Music Audio Analysis in Python and will use some neural nets architecture to generate ’its’ own music.
