Two main tasks of linkers are:

- symbol resolution, where each gloabal symbol in an object file is bound to a unique definition
- relocation, where the ultimate memory address for each symbol is determined and where references to those objexts are modified.


### Three Kinds of Object Files (Modules)

- **Relocatable object file** (.o file)
    - Contains code and data in a form that can be combined with other relocatable object files to form executable object file.
    - Each .o file is produced from exactly one source (.c) file
- **Executable object file** (a.out file)
    - Contains code and data in a form that can be copied directly into memory and then executed.
- **Shared object file** (.so file)
    - Special type of relocatable object file that can be loaded into memory and linked dynamically, at either load time or run-time.
    - Called Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) by Windows


### Linker Symbols

- **Global symbols**
    - Symbols defined by module `m` that can be referenced by other modules. 
    - E.g.: *non-static C functions and non-static global variables*.
- **External symbols**
    - Global symbols that are referenced by module `m` but defined by some other module.
- **Local symbols**
    - Symbols that are defined and referenced exclusively by module `m`.
    - E.g.: C functions and global variables defined with the static attribute. 
    - *Local linker symbols are not local program variables*


### Linker’s Symbol Rules 

- **Rule 1: Multiple strong symbols are not allowed**
    - Each item can be deﬁned only once 
    - Otherwise: Linker error
- **Rule 2: Given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols, choose the strong symbol**
    - References to the weak symbol resolve to the strong symbol
- **Rule 3: If there are multiple weak symbols, pick an arbitrary one**
    - Can override this with `gcc –fno-common`


## Static Libraries

- Concatenate related relocatable object files into a single file with an index (called an archive).
- Enhance linker so that it tries to resolve unresolved external references by looking for the symbols in one or more archives.
- If an archive member file resolves reference, link it into the executable.


### Creating Static Libraries

> Archiver allows incremental updates  
> Recompile function that changes and replace `.o` file in archive.


## Shared Libraries

- Object files that contain code and data that are loaded and linked into an application dynamically, at either load-time or run-time 
- Also called: dynamic link libraries, `DLLs`, `.so` files
