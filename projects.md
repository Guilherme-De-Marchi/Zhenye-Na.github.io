### Nonlinear Component Analysis as a Kernel Eigenvalue Problem

We outlined and implemented algorithm/Pseudo-code for performing Kernel PCA presented in the [paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6790375/) `Nonlinear Component Analysis as a Kernel Eigenvalue Problem` by Bernhard Schölkopf, Alexander Smola, Klaus-Robert Müller. Furthermore, we implemented the toy example and performed SVM classification after using Kernel PCA and Linear PCA  respectively on Iris dataset. Besides, we implemented USPS Handwriting Recognition via SVM given by KPCA and Simple PCA. 

The result concluded that Kernel PCA offered better accuracy (96%) than normal methods.
