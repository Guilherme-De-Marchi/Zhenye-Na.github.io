== About Me

*Research Interests:* /Artificial Intelligence/

I'm a second-year Master student in Industrial Engineering at University of Illinois [https://ise.illinois.edu/ (ISE @ Illinois)], with concentration in Advanced Analytics and Computational Science & Engineering. I worked with [http://jasirign.github.io/ Prof. Justin A. Sirignano] on Deep Learning with High-Frequency Finacial Data. I am currently working with [https://ise.illinois.edu/directory/profile/wrnorris Prof. Bob Norris] on Autonomous Vehicles. My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Within AI, I am interested in problems related to probabilistic modeling, machine learning and deep learning. I obtained my Bachelor Degree in [http://en.dlut.edu.cn/ Dalian University of Technology], majoring in Harbor, Waterway and Coastal Engineering under the supervision of [http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/chentg/zh_CN/index/786083/list/index.htm Prof. Tingguo Chen]. I worked with [http://faculty.dlut.edu.cn/1998011035/zh_CN/index.htm Prof. Meng Jiang] on my thesis topic being "The Structure Design of a Gravity Quay Wall of Ocean Fishery Group in Dalian".
